/// <summary>
/// Shifts OVRCameraRig's trackingSpace so that CenterEyeAnchor ends up at the true
/// center-eye pose reconstructed from the left passthrough camera's real-time pose,
/// computed entirely on-device — no round trip to Python, which used to add a full
/// network+processing cycle of latency and made the pose visibly jittery/laggy
/// relative to real head motion.
///
/// leftCamera.GetCameraPose() (a native OVRPlugin head-pose query, unaffected by
/// anything we write here) internally computes camPose = headPose ∘ LensOffset, where
/// LensOffset is the camera's fixed, factory-calibrated extrinsic relative to the head
/// (leftCamera.Intrinsics.LensOffset — see PassthroughCameraAccess.cs). We invert that
/// composition to get the desired world pose for CenterEyeAnchor: headPose = camPose ∘
/// inv(LensOffset). Then we solve for the trackingSpace pose that places
/// CenterEyeAnchor exactly there (see ApplyCorrection below).
///
/// WHY trackingSpace AND NOT CenterEyeAnchor DIRECTLY: an earlier version of this
/// component wrote straight to CenterEyeAnchor.position/rotation. On a real headset,
/// OVRCameraRig.UpdateAnchors() drives leftEyeAnchor/rightEyeAnchor (the actual stereo
/// render cameras) from independent native eye-tracking queries, NOT from
/// CenterEyeAnchor — so that override never touched the rendered view at all. Worse,
/// Meta's Interaction SDK (hand tracking, ray interactors, etc.) converts tracking-space
/// poses to world space via TrackingToWorldTransformerOVR, which uses
/// OVRCameraRig.trackingSpace — also completely independent of CenterEyeAnchor. Since
/// trackingSpace is the shared parent of CenterEyeAnchor, leftEyeAnchor, rightEyeAnchor,
/// and everything the Interaction SDK derives from tracking space, shifting IT corrects
/// the actual render cameras and all hand/ray tracking consistently in one place —
/// CenterEyeAnchor is just the reference point we use to compute how far to shift it.
///
/// By default (overrideRotation = false) only position is corrected — CenterEyeAnchor's
/// own (OVR-tracked) rotation is left alone, since orientation tracking is already
/// low-latency/high-rate via the gyro and doesn't need correcting. Check overrideRotation
/// to also rotate trackingSpace so CenterEyeAnchor's rotation matches the reconstructed
/// camera-relative pose too — note this rotates everything hanging off trackingSpace
/// (controllers, hands, boundary) around CenterEyeAnchor's position, not just the view.
///
/// An earlier version of this component instead auto-calibrated the offset at runtime by
/// comparing CenterEyeAnchor's current pose against GetCameraPose()'s result — but
/// GetCameraPose() is time-aligned to the camera's own (lower-rate) capture timestamp,
/// not "now", so any head motion between those two moments got baked into the "fixed"
/// offset as a large, bogus error. Using the SDK's already-known LensOffset sidesteps
/// that timing mismatch entirely — no calibration step, no staleness risk.
///
/// Applies the correction every LateUpdate() and again on Application.onBeforeRender as
/// defensive insurance, in case anything else (recentering, boundary system) touches
/// trackingSpace between LateUpdate and render — recomputed fresh each time from
/// whatever trackingSpace/CenterEyeAnchor's current actual state is, so it's
/// self-correcting either way.
///
/// Attach to any persistent GameObject. Drag OVRCameraRig's TrackingSpace into
/// trackingSpace, its CenterEyeAnchor into centerEyeAnchor, and the left
/// PassthroughCameraAccess (e.g. the one used by PassthroughCameraPublisher) into
/// leftCamera.
